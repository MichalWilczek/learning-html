# learning-html
This repository stores the code I developed while learning HTML from [Miroslaw Zelent courses](https://miroslawzelent.pl/kurs-html/). 

The code is mostly rewritten from examples given by Mr. Zelent. I keep it here to have an easy access for myself whenever I'll try to develop my own webpages.
